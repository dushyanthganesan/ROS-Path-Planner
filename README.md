# ROS Path Planner (in Progress)
This is a ROS-based control system and simulator for a point-following robot. This architecture has a vast number of use cases in autonomous systems and robotics. The base path planning algorithm is the A-star algorithm used in conjunction with a trajectory optimizer. Visualization is done in RViz. Developed on Ubuntu 18.04.

Requirements:
ROS Melodic

install dependencies:

sudo apt install ros-melodic-navigation
